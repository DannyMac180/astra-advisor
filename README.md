# Astra Advisor

**GPT-6 Astra plans the work, chooses useful bounded delegation dynamically, and
owns verification and acceptance.**

Astra Advisor is a Codex plugin for capability-routed software delivery. Give Astra
the goal, constraints, and repository context; it decides whether independent work
should run alongside the parent session and chooses a supported native subagent
model and effort for each bounded deliverable.

## Cloud limitation

ChatGPT Work cloud `create_thread` must omit `model` and
`thinking`, so it cannot currently promise arbitrary model or effort control. Astra
does not dispatch a model-pinned request there by default. Native Codex subagents are usable
where the current tool schema exposes the needed controls.

## Quick start

Install the plugin in a current Codex CLI or ChatGPT desktop app with plugins
enabled. Start a fresh task after installation and select GPT-6 Astra at any effort
supported by the current Codex host:

~~~sh
codex plugin marketplace add DannyMac180/astra-advisor --ref main
codex plugin add astra-advisor@astra-advisor
~~~

Start a task with:

~~~text
Use $astra-advisor:orchestration to plan, build, verify, and review this work.

## How routing works

Astra remains the architect and acceptance owner in the primary GPT-6 Astra session
at the effort selected by the user. After capability preflight, Astra records the
parent model and effort as observed or unobservable before implementation or
delegation begins. The skill never changes the parent session.

When delegation helps, Astra uses the exposed generic `collaboration.spawn_agent`
tool with an explicit `model`, `reasoning_effort`, and `fork_turns: none`. It chooses
among `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` from the task's risk,
context, and independent work. There are no predefined role TOMLs, companion
installer, role-to-model mapping, or fixed subagent count cap. Astra gives each
subagent a concrete bounded deliverable and continues useful parent work while it
runs.

Live tool metadata is authoritative. The current documented effort snapshot is:

| Model | Known efforts |
| --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, `ultra` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |

If a selected model, effort, control, or tool is unavailable, conflicting, or
unobservable, Astra fails that delegation closed and reports the limitation. It does
not silently substitute a model, effort, role, or fabricated tool. Chosen values and
runtime-confirmed values are reported separately.

For substantial implementation, Astra inspects the complete diff and reruns the
requested checks, then sends the accumulated change set to a fresh read-only
reviewer. The reviewer can be any of the three supported models at a live-supported
effort. Astra accepts the work only after the reviewer returns `ship`; `fix-first`
requires a new parent verification and fresh review, while `rethink` requires a
revised plan.

## ChatGPT app tasks

Separate app tasks require an explicit user request. For an explicit Codex app task,
`mcp__codex_app__create_thread` supports `model` and `thinking`; call
`mcp__codex_app__list_projects` first for project targets, use a worktree by default
for Git projects, and use local otherwise. Cloud `create_thread` omits both controls,
so the bounded limitation above applies. Do not use an API key, nested CLI, or
invented tool as a workaround.

## Updating
